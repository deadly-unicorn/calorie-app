# UNFINISHED PROJECT

I started this project to get a taste of some backend. I wanted to use Next.js and MongoDB. 

I started following this tutorial: https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/nextjs-building-modern-applications/ . 

After finishing the UI I realized I was having a lot of trouble getting started with mongodb, so instead I hopped onto MongoDB University website and started learning MongoDB. 

Also the tutorial states:

"This article is out of date. Check out the official Next.js with MongoDB tutorial for the latest guide on integrating MongoDB with Next.js". Plus it was not using the Next.js new /app directory, with which I am currently experimenting.

As of 25-2 I am currently taking a break from MongoDB and experimenting with Framer Motion. (I have finished all of basic CRUD, but not Transactions).
